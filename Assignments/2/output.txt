According to research at an English university, it does not matter in what order
the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and 
last letter are in the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you 
can still read it without a problem. This is because we do not read every 
letter by itself but the word as a whole and the brain figures it out anyway.
